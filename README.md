## Acceptance Criteria

I believe that all criteria has been met.
When you click the generate button you are prompted for a number of characters
    If you enter more that 128 it selects 128
    If you select less than 8 it auto selects 8
You are promted to select Upper Case, Lower Case, Numers and Special Characters.
If you choose to skip them all the program selects a few for you.

Please make sure to refresh between instances so all value are cleared out.
